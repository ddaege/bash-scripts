####################  List of commands you can use to make passwords

# ${RANDOM} chooses a random number

rand=echo ${RANDOM}

${rand}${rand}${rand}

# Using the date command (seconds)

password=$(date +%s)

echo "${password}"

# Using the date command (nanoseconds)

password=$(date +%N)

echo "${password}"

# Use a checksum to read the standard input of the previous command and compute a message digest

echo $(date +%s) | sha256sum

# Can also combine them

${rand}$(date +%s%N) | sha256sum

# To make a shortened random password, after combining use the head command
# This will combine the checksum of the date in seconds and nanoseconds then shorten it to 8 
# characters

echo $(date +%s%N) | sha256sum | head -c8

# Add RANDOM to it

perf_pass=$(date +%s%N${RANDOM}${RANDOM} | sha256sum | head -c48)

echo "${perf_pass}"

# Append a special character to the password
# shuf will shuffle in random order
# fold will wrap each input line, -w1 is have the width column be of 1

char=$(echo '!@#$%^&*()_-+=' | fold -w1 | shuf | head -c1)

# Now combine

echo "${perf_pass}${char}"
